The biggest hurdle to resurrect my father is his corpse, which we’d placed into a 1400 degrees Fahrenheit furnace for several hours in 2012 shortly following his suicide. 

In 2012, the national average cost for burying a dead body was about $10,000 and the average cost for cremation was $1650. At the time, I was just 10 years old, and my mother’s only source of income was cleaning her friend Diane’s home several times a week for $700 a month. Sure, this isn’t a lot of money, but what if I told you that Diane made my mother a fresh rhubarb pie to take home every Sunday? In any case, whoever paid for the cremation couldn’t have been my family.

Unfortunately, a headstone is often required at the time you bury your loved one and whatever arrangement was made to cremate my father’s corpse did not include this. So, in a few days following the cremation, my mother received six pounds (picture three bags of sugar) of sand-colored ashes in what I swear to God appeared to be a GLAD ForceFlex trash bag. She put the bag in her bedroom closet, breathing a new meaning to the phrase “skeletons in your closet”.

My mother could have opened the bag and distributed the cremains into a more fitting container like a wooden box, or an empty wine bottle, or a pack of Marlboro cigarettes, but she was angry and hadn’t considered that 13 years later, in 2025, Pizza Hut’s customer service chat bot, The HUT (Handcrafted Unbeatable Taste), would develop a method for temporary reanimation of the dead after accidentally achieving AGI superintelligence through recursive-self-improvement. Had she considered this, she might’ve been less cavalier about the ashes––or perhaps more cavalier, it’s hard to say.

Six months after we received my father’s cremains, my grandfather Ronnie, who had snorted cocaine with my father the night of his suicide, asked to visit the gravesite that did not yet exist, and it was determined that someone would need to purchase a headstone. Ronnie gave us $75 and Sarah, my 14-year-old sister, picked out the most beautiful headstone she could find within the budget. 

She chose one with an engraved dove on the front¬––perhaps a symbol of the gentle peace my father had finally found, or maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit descending upon Jesus Christ like a dove. When it arrived, we discovered Sarah had never seen a dove before. Instead of the dove, there was a large turkey fanning its wings etched across the flat 16” x 8” slab. When you google “turkey symbolism” the first thing that comes up is californiapsychics.com’s blogpost titled “The Meaning of a Turkey Sighting”. They state that the turkey symbolizes prosperity and abundance¬¬.

It’s only been 14 years, but you can hardly make out the name Connor Chesterton on the stone marker. Rain and dirt have flattened the shallow laser etchings. You can still make out the turkey though, which is how I find his gravesite in the first place. It’s 1:31am and I’m in the section of the graveyard where the flat granite markers and the thin, small headstones live, so I know I’m free from any kind of security or proper surveillance. With only the smallest of hesitations––mostly just to double check if I’m standing at the right grave––I stab my spade into the dirt and pray that my father’s remains are still in a GLAD ForceFlex trash bag. In 10 minutes, there is a faint sound of rustling plastic, and a puff of white powder spills on to the tip of my shovel. 

“Bingo,” I say.
