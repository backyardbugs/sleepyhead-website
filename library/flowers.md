I haven’t had a single friend in my entire life. At least, not a real one. I did have a roommate once. His name was Stephen Sneely and he was a dweeb. If I had known then that he would be the closest I would come to having a friend in my 29 years of life, I would have tried harder to look past his dweebishness.

I believe that the current reason I have been unable to make a friend is because my neighbors are so horrendous. If they were less horrid, perhaps I’d be more inclined to make plans with one of the Publix produce associates that I work with. What if we make plans and they ask to come over to my house?

I think that the neighbor nearest to me is the most offensive to look at. Thankfully, I may have found a solution for him.

He’s what I like to call a “piece of shit”. Unfortunately, I have already dubbed another neighbor “Pos” for the same reason. Instead, I call this neighbor Truck Man on account of his obnoxious, flag-adorned Diesel Dually. I’ll tell you about the flag after I tell you a theory I have about Diesel-Duallies.

If you don’t know, a Diesel-Dually is a compensating-for-something’ly large truck with four wheels in the rear instead of two. You’ve seen them before. They come pre-installed with a rap country CD and a foghorn.

My theory is that each Dually is synchronically manufactured with a gas station (I call this their “soul station”). I believe that each Dually wanders gas station to gas station searching for their soul station, like a non-identical twin separated at birth, left forever feeling like there’s a hole in their shoe.

I imagine that when a Dually encounters their soul station, their high beams burst and their driver experiences immediate transcendent ejaculation. I’ve developed this theory to help explain why every Dually driver (Truck Man included) drives with such urgency—the faster they go the more gas stations they can encounter and the higher the odds that they find their soul station. 

Now about that flag. 

When the new president was elected—just another old white man capable of authorizing the use of Hellfire R9X missiles (a favorite for ripping and crushing children’s bodies into millions of little pieces)—Truck Man took down his flag that showed support for the other semi-sentient, loaded mashed potatoes who previously ran the executive branch of the United States of America. I felt relieved with the flag gone. We had entered a new era. This era ended last week when he replaced the flag with another.

He flies this new flag from the back of his Dually, which he parks on the corner of our street, ass out, flag billowing in the breeze, the thin font curling and uncurling with the rippling flag, though still legible, forcing all literate humans on our street (not as many as you would think) to read “Fuck Biden” when they go out for groceries or come home from visiting their grandmother.

I understand the sentiment, though I don’t think he is concerned about the Hellfire R9X missiles. Regardless, I find it to be an unpleasant sight I’m subjected to every single day.

I hate looking at Truck Man and his stupid truck. So, I’ve decided to give him flowers. Flowers you ask? For a man I despise? 

My first instinct was to give him sand or empty Mountain Dew cans or lingering stares from my backyard to his or cigarette butts or distant gunfire or beer caps or even a barking dog chained to a rusting lawn mower—but, he already has those things.

Normally, flowers are the opposite of what you’d give to someone like Truck Man. But, that’s what makes this such a good idea. He won’t suspect that the flowers are actually dangerous! Perhaps even catastrophic! Or, at least, Meme Mezmereme who runs Meme Mezmereme’s Magical Floristry suggested they are.

Despite the delicious alliterations, I’ve never seen customers in her shop. I pass by the place all the time as it’s just a few shops down from the grocery store.

So I go in Meme Mezmereme’s Magical Floristry (this was a couple months ago), because I wanted to know why no one ever comes inside. And I met Meme and I understood precisely why no one ever goes inside.

She’s missing both of her eyes. Where you and I have eyeballs, she’s got black sockets. And that’s not unbelievable, of course. It’s unfortunate, but it happens. I’d seen a man with no nose at a 7-Eleven once while putting relish on a hot dog. Maybe she’d shot shrapnel into her eyeballs while trying to blow up that very man’s nose—who can say.

What is unbelievable, and what likely scares off the patrons, is that every day she sits behind her little desk, legs crossed, sipping a porcelain teacup, while she reads from a paperback book.

“That’s hilarious,” I had said to her. Which, in retrospect, perhaps was mean. But I had truly believed that she’d intended it to be perceived as a gag. I had thought that she was simply being playful and that no one had returned the favor, being too afraid of her eye sockets. I was not afraid because I’d seen the noseless man at 7-Eleven.

“What’s hilarious?” She said. Her voice was delightful! I’d expected a croaking witchy voice to match her eye sockets, crooked nose, and leathery skin. Instead, her voice was bright and bird like. She didn’t look up from her book, and while waiting for my response, turned a page.

“Err…well, it’s—”

“You’ve got mustard on your shirt there, Boon.”

That was my name, and that most certainly was mustard on my shirt.

“Right,” I had said. “Well, thank you.” And then I left.

I came back the next day with a deck of cards.

“What card am I holding up?” I asked her. She put her book down and sighed.

“What do you want?” she asked and leaned against her chair, staring at me the way someone with eyes might if they were bored.

“Just look at the card and tell me what the number and suit is.” She looked briefly at the card (I assumed based on a subtle movement of her chin) and back to me.

“Why?”

“So I can know if you really saw the mustard on my shirt.”

“Why is that important?”

“So I can know if you learned my name before I came or if you intuited it through some dark power.”

“Why does me seeing your mustard mean I didn’t learn your name before you came in?”

“If you can see without eyes, then you are a witch. If you are a witch, you could know my name just by, well, I don’t know how it works.”

“It’s a two of diamonds.” She said.

“And this?” I say, showing another card.

“It’s a Joker with the word, ‘fraud’ written on it, nearly illegibly in sharpie.”

“You are a witch!” I cried and Meme laughed.

“I’m a florist.” She said and returned to reading her book.

I have chewed on this meeting for weeks now. I’ve always been open to the supernatural. This happens when you’re raised on threats of the rapture. I don’t believe in God, of course—this happens when you’re raised on threats of the rapture. But I’m open to the idea that there are some things out there that just can’t be explained. For instance, my grandmother Annie Belle dreamed of a plane striking the World Trade Center just days before September 11th, 2001. What do you do with that?

So, when I found myself frustrated about Truck Man, I was primed to consider Meme Mezmereme’s Magical Floristry as a potential solution.

She’s in her chair reading like always when I arrive.

“I’m looking for a small bouquet of spiteful flowers. Like ones with delicate yellow petals that seduce you to bringing your nose in, only to find they smell of sulfur and cat piss. Something that looks beautiful but will be received as a terrible gift.” I tell her.

“Delightful,” she says and after a few moments perusing her garden produces a small bundle, tied together with a thin silk ribbon. I only recognize a few of the flowers: borages, a sunflower, and tansies.

“So,” I say and inspect them precariously. “These aren’t going to kill anyone are they?”

“No, you’d like these ones over here for something like that. Let me—”

“Nope! These will do! Thank you!”

I take them straight to Truck Man as I am unsure if it is safe to keep them on my person for very long.

Truck Man says something like, “Oh! Well, uh, okay. Thank you!” and takes them carefully from my hands, as if we are exchanging old leaky dynamite that might explode with too sudden of a jolt or shake and I see him toss them out his back window later that day. 

I like to imagine he throws them out because Meme had loaded the bouquet with a spider, or venomous beetle, or bed bugs, but it is probably just because he doesn’t like me. Maybe he’s overheard me watching Naked and Afraid XL and thinks I’m no good. I don’t like him because of his flags, hats, revving engines, and overalls. I imagine he doesn’t like me because I cuff my jean shorts above my knees or because I once went Vegan for nearly a whole month.

I sometimes wonder what makes me so unlikeable. I don’t hang hateful flags from my fence or play country rap songs at dangerous decibel levels. And yet, Truck Man, who does all these things, has friends that visit him. I am disappointed that he threw the flowers away before they had an opportunity to enact justice. But, more so, I am sad that it wasn’t anything about the flowers that caused him to discard them. It was something to do with me.

It rains for a week straight after I give him the flowers and miraculously a colorful bush grows in the spot where the bouquet landed. I have never seen a bush grow so fast. By the end of the weekend, it blossoms to the size of a small sedan.

I am so excited to see this development that I have taped one window blind panel open—enough that I can peek through, but the neighbor will still think the blinds are closed.

Truck Man tries to cut it down, hacking at it with a machete. It is unruly and wild, and he seems to become tangled in its many-colored vines and leaves. He briefly panics, yelping as he pulls himself out of the growth. The bush wins the machete, swallowing it behind a patch of fuzzy orange petals.  He crosses his arms above his chest and turns to face my home, shaking his head slowly from left to right. Clearly, he knows that I am responsible for the unruly bush.

Despite Truck Man’s best efforts, it will not stop growing. He tries weed killer, pesticides, bleach, Four Loko, Drano, AXE Body Spray, turpentine, Antifreeze, motor oil, and gasoline. The mixture of these chemicals seems to only enhance the plant, thickening its vines until they are like long green sausages that stretch out over his entire yard. The plant glows and shimmers as if supercharged from the chemical cocktail. 

Truck Man tries shooting two rounds from his Remington 870 shotgun into the bush. It jiggles slightly from the impact. He squints at the bush and puts his hands on his hips, shocked beyond belief that it didn’t solve the problem.

 In a particularly low moment, he tries backing his pickup truck into the bush, perhaps to crush it. It is as though this is the moment the bush has been waiting for all along. It seizes the truck with its grubby vines, clinging to the open bed and wrapping around the tires. He tries to escape, switching gears and desperately stepping on the gas pedal, shouting at the wretched plant to let him go. The truck groans from the tension and the tires spin in place, forming a cloud of dust around the truck. The cloud shrouds the truck, and I can no longer see the exchange. The squealing tires suddenly stop, and I hear the truck door open and close. When the dust has cleared, the truck is gone. The bush bobs slowly up and down, probably from the remaining transference of kinetic energy, but possibly in a show of victory, a laugh, or a gloat. The man sits on the ground, staring at the plant in grief, folding his hat in his hands.

I am enthralled by Meme’s flowers. The offensive flag is gone, buried somewhere within the vibrant overgrowth, perhaps still bound to a truck tucked somewhere within all those twisting petals and branch like stems. The plant has overtaken his entire yard and even seems to grow all the way through his home. 

Yet, surprisingly, after some time, my neighbor seems to accept the situation. No longer are his days spent fiddling with the roaring engine of his pickup truck. Instead, I see him picking vegetables that grow deep inside the bush. He seems happier. He wears a flower behind his ear, and I even hear talk of him selling fruit and microgreens at the local farmhouse.

It infuriates me that he has adapted to the situation so well. In fact, I removed the tape from my window so I can stop accidentally seeing him there smiling.

I return to the florist the next morning.

“The flowers made Truck Man’s life better. That was not what I was looking for. Didn’t I ask for flowers that smelled like cat piss? You gave him a small business!”

“Tssk,” she says, flipping a page without looking up at me. “Did it really?”

“Yes! They grew into an unbelievably large bush! He loves it!”

“The flag is gone isn’t it?”

“Well, yes, but—well, I didn’t tell you about the flag! Stop doing that.”

“What?”

“That! Your whole, witchy mind reading thing! Stop that!”

“I’ll tell you what,” Meme says, placing her book on the table. “How about we try again. Free of charge. You have other neighbors I presume?”

I do have other neighbors, such as Pos. But I find my mind drifts to another neighbor––the woman. I don’t know her name. We’d met just once at a grocery store. Our hands had bumped when we’d both reached for the same cereal: Cookie Crisps. I’d recognized her then as the woman who lives two houses down from me. We didn’t say anything to each other then. I was going to, but when we locked eyes, it was clear she’d been crying heavily, which I found quite unpleasant.

What bothers me about the woman is that she continues to cry. I’ve seen her gardening, mowing her yard, and collecting mail and every single time she’s crying.

“I see. So, what, you want to punish her for annoying you?”

“No, that’s not what I mean. I don’t know. Maybe something that can make her stop crying?”

 She hands me a single blue flower with a prickly stem.

“What’s it going to do?”

“Who knows,” she says.

“You don’t know?” I say and hastily set the flower on the counter.

“Why’d you even come back here? Just to tell me you were angry with the flowers? Do you want a refund instead?” She opens her register with a clink.

“No, I don’t need a refund. I just think you ought to know that I know that we had an agreement that you deceived me on.”

“Don’t you have better things to be doing? Like one of those, oh what are they called…oh yes, lives! Don’t you have a life?”

“I don’t like your tone,” I say and snatch the flower back.

It wasn’t very nice of her to assume that I don’t have a life. I do have a life, a very vibrant one thank you. Just because I don’t have a close friend or a dog or anyone else doesn’t mean I’m a loser. I would know, Stephen Sneely whom I dormed with was a loser. He had athletes foot four different times in two semesters. Wash your socks, Sneely!

Despite Meme’s slight, I decide to take the crying woman her flower. I feel anxious while I wait for her to answer her door. It’s not as exciting as it was when I’d brought Truck Man his flowers. I’d known exactly what I wanted from our exchange then: his suffering. But now, as I stand here, I feel a little foolish. What am I going to say to her? I nearly drop the flower when her door suddenly swings open. Her cheeks are swollen and pink.

“Oh! Hello, uh. How can I help you?” She says. Her voice is stuffy from a recent session of crying.

“Hi, I’m Boon. We’ve met. Well, kind of. We both were reaching for Cookie Crisps. I don’t know if you remember. Anyways, here, uh, take this, I think, uh, I just wanted to introduce myself and say that uh, if you ever need anything.” I say and hold the flower out for her to take it. She hesitates for a moment, and I steel my hand, so it doesn’t tremble. She finally decides to grab the flower. Our fingers brush each other’s in the exchange and I feel a shiver run down my arm.

“Thank you,” she says. “Uh, I’m Rose.”

“Oh! I brought you the wrong flower then!”

she laughs which catches both of us off guard. It’s a wonderful laugh that lights up her whole face. It’s a shame when the laugh ends, and her eyes return to their heavy drooping state. There is a pause and then exchanged goodbyes and she shuts her door. I want to knock again, to ask why she’s been so upset, to make a joke and prompt her to laugh again. My hand lifts to form the knocking shape, but I let it fall back by my side. 

As I walk home, a large rusty truck speeds right past me, the wide trailer hitched to it nearly scraping against me as it passes. I turn to yell at him but stop when it turns to park in the house across from mine. I shake my head and enter my car, dialing the floristry as I ignite the engine.

“It’s Pos. I need something terrible for this guy. He’s a hot head,” I explain to Meme who answers the phone with a lazy hello. “A real jerk wad. I’m coming now.”

She has the flowers ready when I pull in—a small handful of yellow and green ones. I pay her and bid her goodnight.

I intend to wait until the next morning to give him the flowers, but when I come home, I spot him feeding a bonfire behind his house. His gate squeals from rust and lack of use and he is so startled by the unexpected sound that he nearly falls over. He is in a fit, brandishing a stick and cursing at me. I set the flowers at his feet and back away with my hands out in front of me. He snatches them from the dirt and tosses them into the fire. I don’t see the fire eat the flowers, as I keep my eyes on him (in case he comes at me with the stick), but I can hear the fire make a strange sizzling sound with the addition of the yellow and green tinder, so I know they are gone. I apologize for frightening Pos and back out of his yard as he continues to yell at me. I still hear his muffled distant yells as I fall asleep. 

In the morning, Meme doesn’t answer my call. I dress and exit my house, intent on arriving the second she’s open so I can get more flowers for Pos—indestructible ones if she has them. As I open my car door something catches my eye.

It’s Pos. He sits in the middle of his driveway, Full Lotus position, eyes closed. He is wearing a bath robe, but it has a sort of sacred aura about it and I find myself feeling peaceful just looking at its fuzzy tinsel covered in the morning sunlight. The stick he had threatened me with lays in his lap, resting on the bottom of his feet which are tucked by his stomach in an impressive demonstration of flexibility. I shut the door and walk over to him.

“Whatcha doing Pos?” I ask but become distracted by a stench that stings my nostrils. It smells like fermented fruit, gasoline, and burnt plastic. I put my hand to my nose as I search for the source. It is the fire pit. Or more precisely, it is the vibrant purple smoke that billows from the embers like a sparkling cloud of glitter.

“I’ve given up that name, child.” My neighbor says and opens his eyes. He looks at me and it takes my breath away. It feels as though he is touching my soul with his eyes. He smiles and I feel a profound sense of unconditional love come over me. It can only be described as the love I must have felt in my mother’s womb. I find myself sitting on the ground with him. “Only that in you which is in me can hear what I’m saying. I thought I was somebody, but I saw behind that curtain, that veil. Are you listening, child? It’s all play, all a dance. When you see behind the illusion of self, you find who you really are. You’re the eyes of the universe, God with skin on, branches of the same tree, do you hear me? There’s no separation there, we’re the same thing.”

“So sorry, I need to take this,” I tell him and answer my phone. It is Meme calling me back. “No. Well yes, thank you, but, I’m—” I say, trailing off. “Hang on one second.”

Pos has begun to take deep breaths. Not like deep breaths for meditation or easing one to sleep—deep breaths like a professional free diver fixing to submerge. The stick in his lap lifts into the air, hovering above his body. His body comes next, still in lotus position, floating above the cement, the hem of his bathrobe barely brushing the ground. I clear my throat and put my ear back to the phone. 

“You know what, I’m going to need to come in and speak with you.” I thank Pos for his time and head to Meme. She’s standing there waiting for me when I enter.

“Look, this is getting ridiculous! You gave Truck Man an organic lifestyle and made Pos into some, well, I don’t know what you’d call him. I’m sure you understand what I am asking you for! I want their lives to be worse! Do you hear that? Worse!”

“These are flowers boon. They have to bloom. Don’t you see that? They’re doing their work but you’re not giving them time.”

“How are they going to make these people suffer? Explain that to me.”

“I don’t know! I’m not a torturer. My flowers solve my customers problems. That’s all I know. I promise you, keep going. Buy the rest of your neighbors’ flowers.”

“You’re a con artist! You’re a horrible witch! I’m leaving.”

And I do leave, for some time. But, after a few days I feel guilty for yelling at her. What if she was right and I was simply being impatient. I return to her shop and find a vacant building devoid of her branding, flowers, or any sign of the shop at all. I huff and kick the dirt by the front door.

“Fine. Whatever. Good riddance, then! Skip town why don’t you!” I say, but I feel rotten inside.

Over the next few weeks, even though I do not provide flowers to any of my other neighbors, I begin to suspect that Meme is somehow getting flowers to them as a final punishment for my lashing out. 

One neighbor has a vicious rabid dog. Truck Man tells me that this dog had an allergic reaction after accidentally eating a delicate white lily. At first the owner was upset, thinking that the flower had come from Truck Man’s bush. But after the dog’s drastic change in behavior they stopped their confrontation. It’s become the sweetest dog I’ve ever met, falling in passionate, fervent love with every person, leg, mailbox, bike tire, tree stump, trashcan, squirrel, and stuffed animal it meets. 

The neighbor with dementia, who once knocked on my door at three in the morning to ask for a medium ham and pineapple pizza, receives a large cactus with deceptively soft pink needles. She adores the thing and takes it with her wherever she goes. The cactus has an odd way about it. Like a venus fly trap, it moves with a mind of its own, though differing in the fortunate precise timing of these movements. One day, I see her stumble when she gets her mail and the cactus seems to stretch out one of its arms and catch her. A few days later, I see her driving on the wrong side of the road and it almost looks like the cactus takes hold of the wheel from her! I pass her briefly, mind you, so I don’t see the whole thing. 

The neighbor who always leers at me through my windows as they jog the neighborhood receives a small chia plant that grows an entire maze around his yard in the middle of the night. I haven’t seen him in several days. 

I sit on my porch and consider my neighbors. It boils me that they are thriving. I look at Truck Man watering his unruly bush, daisies in his hair. Meme’s witchery has entirely transformed the people around me, and I find there’s nothing there for me to complain about. They’re all perfect and I’m uncomfortable without one of their annoying interruptions to keep me preoccupied. I almost miss that “Fuck Biden” flag. 

My gaze turns from my neighborhood to my own yard, and I feel a different sensation. It twists my stomach and sours my tongue. My grass is scorched and dying in the summer heat. My yard feels like a desolate wasteland compared to the abundant foliage bursting throughout my neighbors’ yards. I go inside so I don’t have to look at it.

I make myself a glass of strawberry milk and put on the television. What I would do for a dog. A big furry dog that jumps up the second you’re home. The kind that annoys you with how much it loves you. You want him to lay off, to take a step back, because he’s always there and you never feel like you have a second to yourself. The kind that makes you feel like you’re never alone.

I hear a knock at the door and frown, sitting up from my Lazy Boy. It’s almost certainly Janny, the lady with the cactus.

“I’m coming Janny, I don’t mind making you a pizza, but this is not, oh!” I say. It isn’t my dementia suffering old lady neighbor at the door, it’s Rose. 

It is the first time I have ever seen her where she is not currently or had not moments ago been crying. She is in sleeping clothes—a fuzzy purple onesie with little yellow stars all over it—but I feel caught, like I walked out the wrong door and found myself standing on a tightrope, or like I was suddenly injected with heroin, or like I was a thin wax candle held up against the sun.

She coughs and I realize I’ve been staring at her without speaking.

“I’m sorry, I hope it’s not too late, I just needed to come say thank you again.” She says and reveals something from behind her back. It’s a small pot with a little red flower growing in it. I take it from her and she clears her throat again. “So, alright, I just, um. Just. I wanted to say thank you!” She takes a step backwards as if to leave. I want to scream, to stop her, to crawl on the ground and beg her to stay.

“The flower was okay?” I ask. My voice sounds shrill and panicked and I give a small laugh, surprised at how desperate I sound. Rose looks relieved now that I’ve spoken and gives a bright teethy smile. “It didn’t…did it…it was okay?”

“It’s perfect! It sits beside my bed. It was really thoughtful of you. I’ve been in a,” She pauses and runs her hand through her hair, “I guess I’ve been going through it. It’s been hard since, well, and the flower just reminds me that there are good things, and good—sorry, I just wanted to say thank you, not, well, not this. I’ll get out of your hair, thank you again.”

“No! You should stay.” I say, setting the flowerpot by the door and gesturing inside. Rose looks taken aback. I feel taken aback. There’s a pause and I want to turn myself inside out and disappear.

“You want me to come in?” She says, nervously adjusting her hair again. My heart races. 

“Sure! I mean, you’re not bothering me and I would love to talk. I was just watching a stupid show and was about to make dinner and I don’t really have company and I wouldn’t mind, but I don’t mean anything by it, boy I’m, I just meant, you’re not bothering me and you can come in and talk more if you, if you would want to?”

She gives a few big nods and steps towards the door. “What show are you watching?”

“Oh, well, it’s,” I say, but falter when something makes me wrinkle my nose. “Huh? So, what kind of flower did you say this is?”

“I’m not sure!” she says and picks them up, “To be honest, I wasn’t expecting to get them, but when I was at the store today, I bumped into a woman who—”

“Was she wearing sunglasses?”

“She was! Do you know her?”

“I think I might,” I say and lift the flower to my nose. It smells of sulfur and cat piss.
