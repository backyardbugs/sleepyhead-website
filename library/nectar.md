<pre class="poem">
The lashes, pluck and set
in rows. The freckles, sift
as barley. Is cinnamon not
a hexadecimal? Pick that plum
scab and tell me it isn’t sweet.

So what the Goldenrod cups
more than nectar behind her teeth?

The molars, pestle
to moon dust. The lungs, slice
as barrel, trigger, spring. Is mother
not a mothy hymnal? Is lover
not a warm machine? Kiss that yellow
spider and tell me she isn’t sweet.
