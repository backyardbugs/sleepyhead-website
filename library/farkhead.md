

Until six months ago, when I invested in FARK coin, I hadn’t done a single thing right in my entire life. I even came into the world wrong—ass first and six weeks early.

My kid will come out backward too, I’m sure. An almost relevant concern, what with Sara being pregnant and all. Thankfully, it’s not a baby in her stomach. It’s just a cluster of rapidly growing cells that could turn into a kid if left unattended. When we get back from Bali, the non-kid will be blasted with a furnace or smashed with a hammer or however they’re going to do the thing.I blame my mom, of course—not for Sara’s pregnancy or my breech birth, but for everything else. She’s a fucking idiot, just like me. 

She even taught me how to tie my shoes wrong. Everyone else seems to have learned the same method where they only need to make one loop, I’m not sure, it happens too fast to tell. I just know it takes me three times as long to tie my fucking shoes. 

Now picture me doing my taxes or fixing my car. Well, fixing Sara’s car, as I don’t have my own. I did own one, of course. A 2010 Kia Forte. I’ve not gone thirty-one years without owning a car. But I put diesel fuel in it on accident and so I sold it for scrap, which was all they told me it was worth.

But that’s all in the past. Right now, I’m not a fucking idiot. Right now, my and Sara’s luggage is being transported from our taxi to our hotel room because right now, we’re in Thailand’s Le Méridien Chiang Rai Resort for FARK coin’s first annual conference.

We were personally invited because I own 40,000,000 $FARK. Which, at its current valuation, means I have $17,000 in my crypto wallet. Of course, I’m not going to sell it until it’s worth $1,000,000. Because, and this is something Sara hasn’t quite come around to, for the first time in my life I’m not a fucking idiot. 

Sara’s been biting her tongue for the last six months. I think she’s frustrated because she expects that we’ll finally get married now that we have this money. It’s not that I don’t want to. Of course, I do. But I don’t know. Rings are expensive and weddings are expensive and wedding dresses are expensive and we live in that shitty fucking apartment and the fleas in the laundry room keep coming back no matter how many times I cover the floor in baking soda. How can I bring her home from a wedding to a place like that? 

If she can just hold out a bit longer, I’ll be able to give her a lot more than a wedding.

“Dan. Dan, honey. Did they like, tell you where to meet them or are we supposed to wander and hope we run into each other?” Sara says, looking around the entrance plaza.

“Uhh, I’m not sure. But, hey, I told you, no ‘Dan’ while we’re here, baby. We’ve talked about this, you gotta call me by my handle. With the kind of money we’ll have we have to be careful about doxing ourselves.”

“We have talked about this. And I told you. I love you, but I’m not calling you Koopa.”

“Isn’t this beautiful? You know, we can hear the Mae Kok River from here.”

I don’t know if that’s true or if I even pronounced ‘Mae Kok’ right. It certainly sounded foul when I said it, which is not what I was intending. I had skimmed a pamphlet in the taxi, but now I’m wondering if I remembered the river’s name correctly.

“Right,” Sara says and inspects a large purple flower hanging beside her. “Well, it is beautiful.”

“And they have an infinity pool. Have you ever been in one of those? I don’t think we have. What if we hang out there while they take our shit up? Maybe order a cocktail and then go back to the room—”

Sara’s hand seems to instinctually go to her stomach when I mention the cocktail. Of course. I forgot, there’s that thing in there. 

“Oh, well, I mean. Does it really matter if you drink if we’re going to…you know?”

“I guess not. But I’m feeling a little sick anyway. Maybe we should text your friends and see if we’re supposed to meet somewhere.”

She says friends with an inflection. She’s skeptical of them, which I understand. She doesn’t see the brotherhood––she just sees me glued to my phone at odd hours of the night.

When I joined the telegram group, it was obvious that I’d finally found my people. People that seemed to care what I had to say. And maybe that was hard for Sara to understand. There is a genuine connection shared between FARK heads. It’s more than just a group of people invested in the same cryptocurrency. It’s like a family. 

She says family can’t have names like Chee$eWiz or Captain_Groot.

When I finally bit the bullet and put $750 in $FARK at the day and time Captain_Groot told me to (Nearly three-quarters of my monthly wages as a part-time produce associate at Publix) I thought she was going to leave me. But, now that $750 is worth 17,000 fucking dollars, so yes, Sara, I do consider Captain_Groot family.

“Okay. Let me see. But, first, hey, excuse me!” I call out to a staff member as they walk by—a young Thai woman in a pencil skirt. She puts her palms together in a kind of greeting. I wonder if I should do the same but decide not to. “Hey, yeah, thank you, do you have any anti-nausea medicine?”

“Yes, sir. Would you like me to bring you some? If you tell me your room number, I’ll put it on your card.”

“No, thank you,” Sara says and gives me a sort of pleading kind of look, “I’m fine actually. I’ll be fine.”

“Are you sure? You said you were feeling sick?”

The staff member glances towards the door she was headed towards and then back to us.

“Yes, I’m sure,” she says and purses her lips before adding, “It will be five times cheaper if we stop at a local store.”

“Oh, stop it. Don’t worry about that! Thank you, sir, please charge it to room 256. You can bring it to the room, we’ll be heading up shortly. Thank you.”

Sara sighs and thanks the staff member.

It makes me feel good to finally be able to give Sara a taste of extravagance. Granted, we are using her credit card. But she understands that it’s just until FARK offers a fiat on-ramp in Q4 later this year. Once the world can buy $FARK directly from a debit card this thing is going to the fucking stratosphere. That’s an inevitability.

Captain_Groot replies promptly to meet them at the bar situated outside of Favola, the resorts signature Italian restaurant. Personally, if I owned this place, I’d make my Thai resort’s signature restaurant serve Thai food, not Italian. But I guess that’s just me.

It’s a short walk through a garden of flowers and plants that I do not know the names of to Favola. There’s a small group of people sitting and laughing at the bar counter and on the edge of the nearby pool. I don’t actually know what any of the FARK heads look like in real life, so I try to match the voices I’ve heard online to the faces. They all look relatively the same. White and male like me, just richer and better looking and they laugh and talk in a loud self-assured sort of way instead of a self-deprecating, “are you guys mad at me?” sort of way.

“You look nice,” Sara says, catching me fixing my hair. She gives me a warm half-smile. Then she falters and puts a hand to her mouth as if to—

“Oh!” I say as Sara vomits on my sneakers. 

“Shit,” Sara says and then gags, but this time without throwing up organic spinach and mango smoothie, which is what it was. “I’m sorry. I. Woah, I’m sorry, I think I need to sit down.”

“Don’t be! Damn, I’m so sorry. Go sit, I’ll get a—”

“No fucking way, I know that voice anywhere. Is that King Koopa? Woah, what the hell happened here?”

It’s Captain_Groot. We’d talked many times on Telegram and his booming voice is hard to mistake. He looks like Joe Rogan. Picture Joe Rogan. Perfect. You got it. Don’t even adjust your mental picture. 

He had held his arms out presumably for a hug or maybe a handshake, but upon seeing the vomit and Sara and my face, the arms hung wilted and awkward.

“Groot!” I say and look back to Sara who is still standing there, vibrant green vomit on the side of her mouth, unsure if it’s acceptable to go and sit. “Um, sorry, this is my girlfriend Sara, fuck I mean, Sandy, and um, sorry, she’s feeling a little sick. Can you, uh, give us just one moment.”

“Not a problem! It’s great to finally meet you two in person. Wow, even with the throwing up thing you are stunning! Damn! You really held out on us Koopa. It’s nice to meet you Sandy, I’m Captain Groot.”

Groot steps over the vomit and holds a hand out to Sandy. She stares at it for a moment and then glances at me, maybe looking for some kind of an out. I don’t know how to provide her an out, so I nod my head to say, go on, shake the dude’s hand.

She clears her throat and wipes her hand on her shirt before shaking his.

“It’s great to meet you. I’m so sorry, I don’t normally…uh.” she looks at the vomit, “Throw up, I guess.”

“Not a problem. This damn Thai food. You know, why can’t they just serve a burger? Is that so hard? It’s fucking meat and bread. Instead, they got, like, fuck, I don’t even know.”

He says “Thai” like “Thigh” and continues to shake Sara’s hand until she flashes a flat smile and tugs her hand away.

“Yeah,” I say, “Well, give us just a minute and we’ll—”

“You know what, why don’t I,” Groot says and snaps a finger at a woman wiping the bar. She gives us the same praying hands greeting as the previous worker. “So, my friends here made a little mess. Or, a pretty big mess. Guess Sandy ordered the large slime bowl for lunch! Anyways, you think you could clean that up for us?”

“Oh god, I’m so sorry,” Sara says to the woman. She’s much older than the previous staff member. She dismisses Sara with a small smile and a quick wave of her hand. Groot claps his hands.

“Great! Okay, well, why don’t you two come over and I’ll introduce you to everyone!”

“Oh,” Sara says with a flinch when the woman dabs a napkin to the vomit by Sara’s lip. “Oh, thank you.”

“Mai pen rai,” the woman says and puts a chair over the pool of vomit on the ground. She says something else to a passing staff member, but it’s spoken too fast and sharp for me to even catch the syllables.

Groot turns and walks back towards the bar at a pace that assumes we’ll be following behind.

“Are you okay, do you need to go back to the room?” I say quietly to Sara. She shrugs.

“I mean, I don’t feel great. But I don’t think I’m going to throw up again.”

Groot introduces us to the rest of the cast before we can fully debrief. There’s Ezze, Runner_Ra66it, TheDirtyBean, Drippy.eth, and others including some that I don’t recognize from the Telegram server.

“And, I’m sure I don’t need to introduce this handsome feller,” Groot says and pats the back of the guy to his right.  And I do recognize him. “This is Big Bang.”

Big Bang, or Big_Bang_Boom, is the founder of FARK. The day he tweeted he would be attending the conference was the day I booked our flight tickets. Connecting with guys like this is how you get rich.

“It’s so great to meet you, Big Bang,” I say and shake his hand.

“Yeah, likewise. What was it you said your name was? Chupa? Like the cryptid?”

“Oh, no, Koopa. You might have seen me on Telegram or Twitter. I’m, King_Koopa.” 

Big Bang nods his head as if that clears things up for him.

“So,” Groot says, “You got here just in time, Koopa. We got some hot fucking alpha.”

Alpha is crypto-speak for insider trading.

“Seriously just in time too,” Chee$eWiz says.

“Like, in the next few hours, big money is moving. People are aping the fuck on this shitcoin that’s secretly been developing an SBT application for immutable web3 gaming credentials. They’ve got shit dropping in Sandbox literally tonight. Something big. Like, people are saying it might be a virtual Snoop Dog concert in Sandbox with their coin as the SBT for admittance.”

“Ah, man, I wish I had liquid, but I’m all in on FARK,” I say.

“No, you’re not hearing us,” Chee$eWiz says. “Do you hate money?”

Big Bang laughs and the rest of the FARK heads join in. Groot looks like he’s crying laughing, which surprises me because I didn’t think it was that funny. 

Sara taps my foot with her foot. Taking money out of our FARK wallet is an ongoing conversation. We booked the flight here on her credit card to avoid moving money around. Moving a few grand out of the account is really like moving hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the account when you consider what the value of FARK is going to be by the end of the year. Sara thinks that we should have taken enough out to pay for this trip and get married. If I move money out of the account for this…

“I don’t know. I mean, how sure is it?”

“Look man, I get it, you’re not used to playing the game. Just put like a small amount in then. Like, throw just a few thousand bucks in, ya know?”

Right. Just a small amount. Thousands of dollars is a small amount.

“What kind of profit are we talking? Is it just going to double? Or?”

“Nah man, I’m talking like ten or twenty times what you put into it by the end of the night. Just gotta make sure you get out before the whales dump it.”

I look at Sara, who has that face on—the one that says, I will curb-stomp you right now in front of your friends.

“Baby, what do you think?”

“Make sure mommy says yes, first!” Big Bang says and everyone laughs again. Sara flashes an unnaturally large smile.

“No, no, King Koopa is a big boy and doesn’t need his mommy’s permission. Go ahead and do what you think is best,” Sara says. “I’m just going to go ahead and go up to our room, so you boys have fun.”

I can’t think of what to say to her as she picks up her purse and walks away.

“Okay! I’ll see you in a bit! Love you!” I say and she waves back at me without turning around. I shrug at Groot. In for a penny, in for a pound. “What’s the shitcoin?”

Groot helps me find the GoblinCrystal token and I exchange $1,000 of FARK for $1000 of GoblinCrystal—which comes out to a bit less after the costs for exchanging. The FARK heads raise their drinks when I show them the transfer.

After a couple hours and a handful of drinks, Big Bang says he has to leave, and the group starts to disperse. I tell Groot and Chee$eWiz goodnight and make my way to our hotel room.

The room is in total darkness when I unlock the door. I flip on the light and hear Sara groan from the couch.

“Shit, sorry,” I say and flip the light off. “I didn’t know you’d be asleep so early.”

“Don’t feel good,” she mumbles from under the thick duvet she’d dragged from the bedroom to the couch.

“Pregnancy stuff or something else, you think?”

“Pregnancy stuff. Nauseous. Boobs hurt. Tired. Feel like shit.”

I lift her feet and slide to sit under her legs on the couch. She’s still wearing her shorts and blouse.

“Do you want this stuff off?”

“Nuh uh. Back rub.”

I nod and pull out my phone so I can check on $GoblinCrystal while I gently trace the flower tattoo on her back. I can’t see the tattoo under the blouse, but I know the lines like I know my childhood neighborhood.

Fuck. The shitcoin hasn’t shot up like they said it would. It’s down. Like, down down. Like, the $1,000 I put in is now worth $288. What the hell?

“Hey, baby?” Sara says and I almost drop my phone. I put on my best boyfriend voice.

“What’s up?” I say.

“Do you think we’ll ever have a baby?” She says and I stop tracing the tattoo. 

“Do you want to have a baby?”

There’s a pause and then what I assume is a shrug, but it’s hard to tell from this position.

“I don’t know.”

“Well, I mean…you’re pregnant. Are you thinking we should keep…like, keep being pregnant?”

“I don’t know. I don’t think so. Just thinking about what that might be like, is all. Like, if there were a baby here with us on this trip, ya know? Like, what would a baby think of Thailand or  Captain underscore Groot? What would it be like to go to the pool with a baby? Maybe that would be something we would like. Have you ever thought about that?”

I don’t know what to say to that, so I resume tracing her tattoo. She doesn’t say anything else and after some time we both fall asleep.

The next morning, Sara wakes me up by jumping on top of me. 

“Wake up! Wake up! Guess what! I don’t feel sick! I feel amazing. I haven’t felt this good since we took that fucking pregnancy stick. I don’t feel nauseous. My boobs don’t hurt. I think I’m finally over the hump!”

“That’s great,” I say and put the body pillow over my head.

“No, no, no! We’re going out! We’ve got your stupid fart coin conference thing tomorrow, so today is my day. I’ve been up for an hour and I have it all figured out. I didn’t think I’d be able to do anything since I felt so sick, so I hadn’t even really looked up anything, but now!” She takes my blanket and starts whipping it up and down like those kindergarten rainbow tents. “Now, I’m unstoppable! And did you know that we are just a few miles from Wat Rong Khun? Do you even know what that is?”

“Nope,” I grumble and try to snatch the blanket back. We tug it back and forth. While wrestling for the blanket, through gritted teeth, she continues talking.

“Its. Ugh! It’s. A. Temple!”

She succeeds in wrenching the blanket from me and lands on her butt from the remaining force of her pull. She blows a strand of hair out of her face and continues.

“It’s also called the White Temple. This artist has been working on it for, well, a while, I don’t know. And he spent like thirty million dollars on it so far. And it’s not even going to be done until 2070. Which! That’s crazy! We might not be alive then. But, we’re alive now, and so we’re going.”

And so we do go.

Before we leave, I check my phone and find that while my $GoblinCrystal is somehow worth even less than it was last night, $FARK has shot up in value. If I hadn’t taken out that $1000 we’d have made about that much. But, instead, we’re back to about $17,000 total between the two coins. It’s frustrating to not have the full profit I should have, but I resolve to not let it eat at me and instead take it as a lesson learned. The lesson being to never cheat on my beloved $FARK. It’s gotten me this far.

We take a taxi to Wat Rong Khun in Chiang Rai. Even the drive over is breathtaking. There are temples alongside cafes and bunches of street vendors. The vendors are like a not-redneck version of the flea markets we’re used to in Florida. I’ve seen these kinds of vendors watching Anthony Bourdain or David Chang and have always wanted to experience them myself. It just seems like there’s this communal experience that I will never have inside of a Walmart Supercenter. And while there are those flea markets at home, they’re less wholesome and more centered around fake Pokemon cards, designer puppy breeds, and the NRA.

Past the city, it’s all rice paddies and quaint traditional Thai houses perched on swaths of green fields. The taxi driver explains that he used to live in Northern Thailand. Despite the tourists and changes in Chiang Rai, there’s a proud heritage closer to Wat Rhong Khun that hasn’t changed in decades.

“What more could you need?” he asks, gesturing to the rice paddies before we arrive.

The White Temple is a contemporary Buddhist temple. Or at least, that’s what Panya, the taxi driver told us. It was designed and built by the Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat.

“I must admit, I’m surprised to see Venom and Predator here,” I say to Sara. The temple is a striking bone white with shards of glass and mirrors built into the spires that hang off the structure. When light hits it, it looks like Edward Cullen in the sun. It’s beautiful. But, in the exterior, it also has just as intricately designed pop culture statues, such as Venom from Spider-Man. 

“Har har,” she says. “Come on, I want to cross the bridge of rebirth.”

Inside the temple, the “Bridge of the Cycle of Rebirth” is what visitors come to see. It’s a long narrow bridge that stretches over a koi pond. Before you reach the pond, you must cross Mara’s mouth.

“Uh, baby, this is creepy. You are a creep for choosing this place. Why didn’t I realize you were a creep before.”

“Shut up,” Sara says, “They’re not gonna get you.”

Mara’s mouth is a pit full of hundreds of stone hands made of the same shimmery bone reaching up to grab you. Amongst the hands are faces of the damned—people who weren’t able to shed their carnal nature.

“Come on,” Sara says, standing in the center of all the hands. 

“Hey, that’s kinda hot actually.”

“Yeah, you know, maybe you shouldn’t cross it on second thought.”

My phone buzzes in my pocket. I consider leaving it there in my pocket, but I’ve been waiting for Groot to respond to my texts about $GoblinCrystal. It could be a $1000 phone call.

“One sec,” I say and walk back to the entrance door and check my phone. It’s Chee$eWiz calling from telegram.

“Are you serious?” Sara says from the bridge.

“Just a second, I’m sorry, I need to take this. It’ll be like two seconds.”

“Dan, we’ve not had a single day free in the past six months. We’re in Thailand. Please, just take like an hour off from all this shit and spend the day with me.”

I tap the back of the phone, watching the call animation cycle. It’s probably only got a couple more rings left in it before it goes to voice mail. You know what, I’m going to bite the bullet for both of us. If the price of providing everything in the world for her is making her mad today, I’m going to have to pay it. I answer the phone.

“Hey, I only have a moment. What’s up?”

Sara shakes her head and turns around to finish the tour of the temple. 

“Dude, have you checked FARK?”

“Uh, this morning. Yeah, it looked good. Great. Why? Did it go up even more?”

“No. Dude. It tanked. Big Bang rugged us. He sold all his FARK and left the resort. No one knows what the fuck is going on. All the whales are dumping.”

“What?”

“Groot dumped his at the same time Big Bang did. That fucker. He didn’t say shit to me. He got a fucking heads-up and didn’t say shit! Wait. I bet you knew, didn’t you? Did you dump too? I hadn’t thought to check your ledger since, well, you know, you’re not a whale.”

“No, man. I don’t even. Dude, what are you talking about? Why would Big Bang and Groot dump their FARK a day before the conference when the fiat ramp would be announced?”

“I don’t know. But they did. Check your wallet and get over here.”

Chee$eWiz hangs up the phone. I open my wallet app and read off the numbers. It feels like my mouth is full of chalk. 

$FARK: $580.44

$GoblinCrystal: $90

“No.” I say. I’m going to be sick. “No, no, no.”

I refresh the screen.

$FARK: $577.59

$GoblinCrystal: $90.20

I taste copper and start to gag. How could this happen? It’s gotta be a prank. It can’t be real. This can’t be happening to me. How am I going to tell Sara? How are we even going to fucking get home? I could sell the ring. No, I can’t. God. Fuck.

“We have to hurry, the taxi’s here,” Sara yells from the other side of the bridge. She’s walking fast.

“What? Why? Why’d you call a taxi?” I ask. How does she know already?

“Because I’m not doing this shit. It’s humiliating and I’m putting my foot down. When we’re spending time together, I want to really be spending time together. I want to look at you and know that you’re looking at me and are really there. Do you even know the last time I looked at you and felt like you were thinking about me? When I’m standing right in front of you, it’s like you don’t even see me.”

“Oh,” I say, “Oh. I’m sorry. Okay, yeah, we can go.”

“See! Right now! Right now, you aren’t thinking about me. I’m fucking yelling at you and where are you?”

My body feels cold and my hands are buzzing. Sara sighs and covers her face in her hands.

“Let’s just go before the taxi leaves,” she says. 

I hardly remember the taxi ride, let alone finding the taxi. The next moment the taxi door is opening and we’re exiting the automobile.

“I need to go talk to Chee$eWiz.”

“Do whatever you want,” she says and heads to the elevator. 

Chee$eWiz is at the Favalo bar. He’s not the only guest there, but he’s the only Farkhead that I can see. He’s hunched over his cell phone, surrounded by a mess of empty cocktail glasses.

“Hey man,” I say and sit down. I realize my body has naturally found the same caved-in shape as Chee$e’s.

“Oh. Hey, Koopa. Wa..want a drinky?”

“Yeah,” I say. “Yeah, I do.”

Chee$eWiz tells me that he knows why everyone sold their FARK. Congress passed some kind of law that made FARK’s entire company illegal. It would take a complete restructuring of the company to get back above board. Big Bang received a heads up, as he’d been in a legal battle for some time. He let his closest lackeys know. They’d let their closest lackeys know. Apparently neither Chee$e nor I fit the bill.

“And GoblinCrystal? What about that?”

“Yeah, they cashed out of that too. Honestly, I think they were just fucking with us.”

After a few hours, the waitress tells Chee$e that she’s going to have to cut him off. She says that I’m close, but that I can still drink another if I’d like. I wish Chee$e a good night, shoot the final drink in one gulp, and head to my room.

Key cards are a marvelous invention. Perhaps created in part to rescue locks from a drunken man with a brass key. After a failed attempt to enter a room that turned out not to be our room, the correct lock dings green and I stumble inside.

The lights are on, and Sara is sitting on the ground, surrounded by a broken plate, tossed clothes, and a tipped-over chair.

“Oh my god! Are you okay? What’s happened?”

Sara is crying so hard that she can’t catch her breath. The kind of cry where it gets stuck for a second before she makes a heavy wailing sound. 

“Fuck, what happened?” I say, trying to come over to her without stumbling. She swats me away.

“No! I don’t want your help!”

“Oh,” I say. She must have checked on FARK. “I think I understand.”

“Yeah? And what’s that?”

“You saw FARK. That everyone dumped it. That it’s all gone. That we’re broke.”

“What?” Sarah says, catching her breath in hiccups. “What are you talking about?”

“What?”

“No, not me what. What you!”

“You’re…this isn’t about that?”

“It’s all gone?” Sara says holding her hands out. I pull the kitchen chair out and slump into it. Sara reads my face and starts to laugh. The laugh grows until she’s doubled over and sounds like a hyena. And then it morphs into an agonizing cry.  Sara’s body heaves with every breath as she tries to halt her crying.

“I’m so sorry,” I say. “I don’t—

“I lost the baby.”

“What?” I ask. “What do you mean? How do you know?”

“I know. There’s blood. And. I just know. Okay? I know.”

“We should go to the hospital.”

“With what fucking money, dipshit?”

My mind goes to the box in the drawer. I don’t know how we could sell it in time, but if it’s the only option, I’ll figure it out. She sighs.

“I don’t need to go to the hospital. Not until we’re home. I talked to my mom. She’s been through it. I’m not bleeding badly. I’m okay to wait.”

“You told your mom?” I ask. As if she doesn’t hate me enough already.

“Of course, I told my mom, asshole.”

“I’m sorry,” I say. I try to reach my hand out to comfort her and she slaps it away.

“No! You don’t get to fucking comfort me right now! We’re in fucking Thailand while I’m miscarrying with less than no money because you had the bright idea to use my credit card instead of your stupid fart money! You absolute. Fucking. Idiot!”

“I’m sorry okay. I’m sorry. I wish I could take it back. I’m stupid okay? I wanted everything to be…I just thought. God. Fuck. I—”

“Get out. I don’t want you to be here tonight.”

“What?”

“Get. Out. Of. The. Hotel. Room.” She says and throws an article of clothing at me with each of the words.

“You just had a miscarriage, I’m not leaving. I’ll stay in the laundry room or something.”

“Get out!”

“Fuck! Are you crazy! Stop screaming!”

“Geeeet oooooout! Get out! Get out! Get out!” Sara screams as loud as she can. She’s going to wake the entire resort. I grab my keycard and go. 

For a while, I just pace the hallway. I’d go to the bar, but it’s closed, and I wouldn’t be able to get a drink anyway. So, I walk without a destination. I find the gym, a couple indoor swimming pools, a rec room. It feels like a dream. There aren’t even workers. It’s just me and varied patterns of wallpaper.

It’s not even as luxurious as it was made out to be when they’d planned the conference. It’s nicer than any hotel I’ve ever been to, of course. But there’s dust on the walls and the carpet is outdated in the hallways. There are cobwebs around the paintings. It occurs to me that it’s even kind of cheap. The entire trip cost us about $3000. It’s an amount that hurts, knowing that it’s nearly maxed out Sara’s card and we’re going to struggle against the interest growing for years to come. But, $3000 for a luxury resort? Is this the budget of millionaires?

I’ve wandered my way to the entrance where the taxi dropped us off. The stars are out. Now that’s beautiful. In Thailand, or at least, where we are in Thailand, there isn’t as much light pollution as in Florida. There are more stars in the sky than I’ve ever seen. If we did have that baby, I’d want to show them this.

A taxi pulls up to the entrance and I shield my eyes from the sudden high beams. A familiar-looking man steps out from the taxi and begins to sort of creep along the outside perimeter of the entrance as if to not be seen. It occurs to me that he kind of looks like a celebrity. He has a familiar silhouette, sort of like how Joe Rogan would look if he were obscured in shadow…

“Groot?” I say into the dark and the Joe Rogan shadow pauses. The pause lingers. “Groot?”

I hear something that sounds a lot like “fuck” and then the shadow steps out into the light.

“Koopa! Hey! So glad I got to see you before I head out. I left my computer. I was just going to run up and get it.”

“Why didn’t you tell me everyone was dumping FARK?”

“Oh, shit,” he looks to the entrance and back to me, as if considering making a break for it. “Yeah, man, shit. I’m sorry about that. It was just a crazy day, you know? Shit moved so fast. But, look, I’ll get you next time, yeah? Don’t even stress. There are tons of moves still. FARK’s going to pivot and that’s going to be big. I mean, if anything, you know, my advice is to buy the dip. Yeah, use this as a time to accumulate more. Then you’ll really be rich when this shit takes off you know? Well, man, it was great seeing you. I do gotta run though, I got the cab—”

According to Sara’s friend Liv—who was a brown belt when she was twelve years old—when you punch something, you’re supposed to distribute the punch over your first two knuckles—your index and middle fingers. The ring and pinky fingers are composed of smaller bones with a significantly higher chance of breaking.

Of course, as my bundled fist makes contact with the side of Groot’s head, I’m not thinking about Liv’s instructions.

If anyone had seen the punch, they’d have said that it sounded like a gunshot. And that sound was not because I threw the greatest haymaker Thailand has ever seen––though I did try. It was the sound of several of my metacarpal bones shattering against each other.

“What the fuck?” Groot says and holds his hand up to his ear, which I hope stings. I’m kneeling, holding my hand to my body, and taking deep breaths from the pain.

Getting punched in the face is strange because the strike happens faster than your brain can register it. It’s a flash of movement and then it feels like your skull is clobbered by a baseball bat. Like, the movement, sound, and sensation all happen together, and it’s hard to parse what happened, where the punch was thrown, or what I could have done to get out of the way. If you’ve ever tried to catch a baseball and missed the thing by an inch, only to have it crack against your cheekbone—it’s like that. And worst of all, Groot doesn’t nurse his fist after he hits me.

I fall to the ground and cover my head like I’m in a grade school tornado drill. Groot kicks my exposed ribs and stomach and I find that those hurt just as bad as the punch to the face. It’s hard to say which I prefer, which is something you must decide when you’re defending your body from an assault. 

Eventually, he stops. Maybe he’s tired or thinks I’m dead. I don’t know. Before he leaves, he spits on me for good measure. I understand that. I’d do the same. It’s just what you do when you finish kicking someone’s ass.

I lay there for a few minutes. Both because I want to wait until Groot has left and because I feel like I was just beaten up by a Joe Rogan look-alike.

When it feels unlikely that he will return, I scrape myself off the ground and limp back into the resort.

“Sir, are you okay? Do you need medical attention?” the woman who had given us our nausea pills says to me when I step inside. Her face is flushed as if she’s seen a ghost. 

“Oh, me? No, no. Thank you, so much. The nausea medicine was very helpful. Thanks so much. I’m just gonna go ahead and go to bed, thank you.”

“Here,” she says and hands me my keycard, which I must have dropped. “Please call the front desk if you need anything.”

I give her my best thumbs up with my non-broken hand and enter the elevator. I wonder what I will tell Sara but decide that might not even be a concern. Maybe she won’t let me in anyways. Maybe she had the lock changed. I suppose they can do that, right? It’s digital after all.

The door does unlock, and I hobble inside. There’s a table lamp on, bathing the room in a soft warm glow. Sara lies on the ground, surrounded by more debris that she must have thrown or swung around when I left.

I go to the drawer and take out the white box, putting it gently into my pocket, which is surprisingly challenging to do without the aid of my right hand. And then I lay down beside her and put my arm around her.

I’m certain that she is awake. I wasn’t subtle when I entered the room. But now I’m concerned that maybe she’s not giving me the silent treatment. Is she okay? Could she be unconscious from the miscarriage?

Her hand wraps around my hand and she pulls my arm closer to her. My hand rests on her belly, where there was once a collection of rapidly multiplying cells.

“To answer your question, I hadn’t really thought about having a baby.” I whisper. “But, I could. I could imagine what it might feel like to show them the stars, or Diet Coke, or Super Smash Bros Melee.”

She doesn’t say anything. As we lay there, our breathing synchronizes. It’s one of those magical things that Sara told me about. When people watch an emotional movie together or sing together or hold a silence that words could never fully speak to together, their heart rates and respiratory rhythms synchronize. She had said something beautiful about it. To me, it’s like in Dragon Ball Z when Goten and Trunks do the fusion dance and become one being, greater than the sum of their parts.

“You can’t give a baby Diet Coke.” She says.

“Will you marry me?”

“What?”

“Will you be my wife?” I say and slide the box out of my pocket. I bring it across her body so it’s in front of her and open it. Even in the warm lamp light, the diamond glistens.

“What the fuck? Where did you?”

“When FARK blew up. That day I cashed out just enough to buy this. I’ve had it for the last six months.”

“What…Why…And after all this, why do you think I would say yes? And why now? Of all the times to ask me?”

I don’t know the answer to that.

“I love you. I should have asked you years ago.”

“You’re right. You should have,” she says. My stomach sinks worse and deeper than when I’d lost it all. Her body feels rigid and still as if she’s holding her breath. I blink and begin to close the box, but she stops my hand. 

She turns over and gasps. 

“What the fuck happened! Are you okay! You’re face! Your hand! Your covered in blood!”

“You should see the other guy,” I said. I’d always wanted to say that.

“What other guy? Did you get jumped? We need to go to the hospital.”

“Groot. I hit him.”

Sara’s mouth drops open and I feel a flicker of pride swell up in my chest. She puts her hand on my face.

“God. You stupid, stupid thing. Really, you should go to the hospital.” 

“I don’t want to spoil the mood, but remember we don’t have any money?”

Sara grabs the box and holds it up.

“No, baby, we can’t. I mean, if we need it for you, for the miscarriage, yes. But, not for a broken hand and some bruised—”

“Broken hand!” She grabs my arm, which causes me to wince significantly. “Oh my god, it’s practically purple!”

“I’m okay.”

“How much do we have left of Fark?”

“Oh God, do we really want to know?”

“Oh shut up,” Sara says and grabs my phone. She taps the screen a few times and then scrunches her face. “Wait, what? Is this right?”

She turns the screen to me.

$FARK: $324.98

$GoblinCrystal: $13,499.33

“What the fuck?” I say.

“Is that real?”

I take the phone and refresh the screen several times. The number is still climbing. 

“I think it’s real.”

Sara’s face is hard as steel.

“What are you going to do?”

I refresh the screen again. 

$FARK: $323.31

$GoblinCrystal: $13,801.20

“Fuck, it’s really climbing,” I say. How much did Groot say it would climb by? Twenty? So, it could be $20,000 if I let it ride? I put the phone in Sara’s hand. “It’ll be easier if you do it. You have two hands.”

“Do what?”

“Cash out.”
