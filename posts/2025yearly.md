My 2025 yearly theme was The Year of Routine. Did I stick to a routine? No! But I did get addicted to cigarettes. What else did I do?

### Gatebound - MFA Thesis Novel
I set a goal to write 100k words in 2025. I’m ending the year with 84,406 words written for my debut novel, Gatebound. My current draft has 60k words. C’s get degrees and baby, 84% is a B. 

Let’s look at some stats regarding the writing:

Weekday Sums Across The Year:
| **Week Day** | **Total Word Count** |
|---|---|
| **Monday** | 12,658 |
| **Tuesday** | 12,332 |
| **Wednesday** | 19,847 |
| **Thursday** | 15,247 |
| **Friday** | 12,898 |
| **Saturday** | 4,650 |
| **Sunday** | 6,774 |
| **Total** | **84,406** |

My year consisted of bursts of productivity followed by long breaks.
* **17 Days:** My longest consistent streak was **17 days** in a row.
* **77 Days:** My longest break from writing was **77 days** (over 2.5 months).
* **2613 words:** The most I wrote on a day was **2,613 words**. My average was **1,017 words**.
* **22%:** I wrote on **83 out of 365 days**.
  * If I could just bump that from 22% to 33% (writing 1 out of every 3 days) while keeping the same average word count, I would have finished the year with **120,000+ words** instead of 84,000. 

#### What have I learned from writing 84,000 words this year? 
* **Writing is really fucking hard.** Not just in a craft sense—that’s a different kind of hard. More of in a *jesus christ is this ever going to be done? should it even be done?* kind of hard. It’s a very “push the boulder up the hill” kind of exercise. Some days, it doesn’t look like the boulder even moved. But, when you look back after 12 months, damn, we traveled somewhere! I wrote so much that the idea of starting over to reach where I’m currently at seems impossible. In other words, I did something that feels presently impossible to me. Neat! So, I suppose I now just do that again next year and I have a book? At the very least I’ll have a finished draft of said book. 

Here’s a quote from Akira Kurosawa in regards to this: 
> “I think young people today don’t know the trick of it. They start and want to get to the end right away. When you go mountain climbing, the first thing you’re told is not to look at the peak but to keep your eyes on the ground as you climb. You just keep climbing patiently one step at a time. If you keep looking at the top, you’ll get frustrated. I think writing is similar. You need to get used to the task of writing. You must make an effort to learn to regard it not as something painful but as routine.”

* **I don’t think I’m going to have redraft this thing too many times.** After a workshop and some discussions about the draft with some professors, I am realizing that the draft may be not be a complete dumpster fire. I mean, it is—but in a way that doesn’t require a complete scrap and overhaul. Once I finish the draft, it may be that I just need to put out the fire over in this corner, move some trash out of this pile into another pile, sweep up the rat shit, and voila! Baby’s first novel!

* **I don’t think I want to redraft this thing too many times.** At the end of the day, it’s my first time writing a book. If I’m serious about being an author, it can’t be my last time writing a book. And while I will end 2026 with a master’s degree and a non-zero amount of writing/workshop/teaching experience, I am still very much a toddler in applying that to the novel. So, I guess what I’m saying is that I’d like to take the pressure off. Let’s get this first one out of the way, warts and all. It doesn’t need to be the best book in the world. If everything goes according to plan, it will be the worst book I’ll ever write, regardless of how many drafts I give it. 

Here’s an excerpt from Gatebound to close this section out. Po is a spirit that kinda looks like Gengar. May is the hero of the story—picture Brienne of Tarth mixed with the lead star of Stick It (2006). The blocktext format here fucks with the formatting--the dialogue between them is supposed to be italics ala Eragon but it made it all italics. I'm sure you'll be able to parce it out.
> *Because I like you. You’re nice and brave and tough.* Po said as if it were obvious.
>
>             *But you bonded to me before you met other nice and brave and tough people. There are far nicer. Far braver. And far tougher. And you could have bonded with someone without sealed gates. Now you’re stuck with me and with your sickness.* May said and felt tears brimming at her eyes. She’d needed to say all of this since Orrick revealed her gates were sealed. *I am so sorry that you’re bonded to me, Po.*
>
>             *I don’t care about all that.* Po said and put his hand on her arm. May thought that he was trying to comfort her, but she realized he was trying to slip a leaf he’d torn from a plant into her khema pocket. She let him.
>
>             *But what if no one can unseal me, and you die?* May said, her voice barely a whisper.
>
>             *I would’ve died in the undercroft, too. But now I get to see all of this.* Po said and gestured to the pathetic garden as if it were a robust forest.
>
>             *You’re only saying that because you think those are the only options. Bonding to a broken girl or dying alone in the undercroft. But what if you had left the undercroft and bonded to someone whole?*

### Other things
* Worked out 78 times.
* Read 34 books.
* Recorded and Released High Press’s Thanks For Asking EP. I mixed and mastered one of the tracks—Better Than You. The EP got 7,295 streams. 
* Julep recorded and released Spring Break Mix EP (Petty and All Apologies)
  * We also have written and recorded So Baby, Ricky Ricardo, and Crashing Out. Almost done mixing them.
* Went to Warped Tour with the dudes in High Press

* Played 7 Julep shows. Some full band, some jukebox style with tracks.
* Played 6 High Press shows. 
* Got a tooth pulled.

I also smoked one million cigarettes, gained some weight, grew out my hair, and started wearing my hats backwards. 

***

So, next year I’ll graduate with a master’s degree. I’ll be the first in my family. I dropped out of high school, just as both my parents did. When I got my AA and my BA, I didn’t take the time to celebrate. I think in some ways I still felt I hadn’t done enough to overwrite the shame of dropping out of high school. I didn’t walk for either of those graduations. I’ll walk this time. 

And then I’ll need to find a job. I hear those are lovely.

And I’ll finish Gatebound. 

It’s a year of endings and beginnings. We’re going to call it The Year of The Threshold, because I can’t think of anything better. 

Anywho, thanks for reading. Happy New Year!
