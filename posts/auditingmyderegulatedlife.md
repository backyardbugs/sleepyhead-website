# # Auditing my deregulated life
### Audit
I’m feeling a bit unclear on the projects I’m juggling. So, let’s take a look at what I’ve been working on for the past couple of weeks:

- High Press is writing music again. We have a delusionally ambitious goal for this batch of songs. We’d like to write and release the best emo single of 2026. Not the best single for us—the best single released by any band in the genre for the year. The plan is to write 20-30 songs, pick the three best from the batch, and develop them as far as we can. Then, pay one of the leading producers in the genre to do pre-production and cowriting on one of those three fully fleshed out songs to push it the extra mile. Then tracking, mixing, and mastering with great audio engineers. At the end of it, maybe we won’t actually write 2026’s Welcome to the Black Parade, but we will at least have the best High Press song we can possibly make. We’ve written about 10 song seeds so far, and a couple of them are absolute gas.
- High Press landed a show opening for a band called Good Terms on February 12th at Crowbar. This will probably be the biggest show we’ve played. I’ve got to do some things to prep for the show. We want a new shirt, so I’ll be designing that, and we haven’t had a proper practice in a minute, so we’ll be tightening up the set, and we’d like to hit the promo for this show hard, so I’ll be designing some assets for that as well.
- I just finished mixing/mastering for Julep’s next single, Waterworks. Now we’re figuring out the release plan. Call (813) 602-1690 to hear a teaser.
- Still writing new music for Julep. This week we’ve been working on a song called Tom Hanks. It’s been distracting me from all the other stuff on this list. 
- I’ve been preparing to submit my thesis to my thesis committee. This involves editing what I have already written, writing an introduction, and formatting the document for the submission.
- I began my final semester of my MFA. I’m teaching two English Composition 1102 classes and taking two classes. Because it’s my final semester, the required electives I put off have finally come home to roost. So, I’m taking a class on teaching professional-technical writing and another on scholarly research instead of my usual creative writing courses.
- I drastically improved the website’s development process. I’d like to write a blog post going into more detail on this. But the gist is that I have connected the Neocities API to a GitHub repository, pushing live updates from VSCode. I can’t begin to tell you how much easier this is than what I was doing before. 
- I’m sober from cigs and alcohol for January. 

### Deregulated
 
The new year and new semester have started off nicely. I like the kids I’m teaching. I like my schedule, even though my Mondays are crammed. My creative projects are fulfilling and thriving. But I have become deregulated.

I added a counter in Captain’s Log that tracks how long it’s been since I’ve worked out or added to the Gatebound wordcount, and I went about two weeks without a workout and am currently on a two-week dry spell for Gatebound. I’ve also found myself feeling anxious and lethargic––dare I even say, depressed. Adjusting to a new schedule often throws me for a loop like this. It’s not so bad.

Now, as far as going to the gym and my diet. That’s a little too important to put off until January. I would’ve thought that not smoking cigs or drinking alcohol would’ve significantly improved my well-being. But admittedly, I kind of feel worse in my body. I realize it’s only been 21 days. But I suppose I was hoping to feel a little lighter, a little happier, a little clearer of mind and spirit. The conclusion is not, “I should start smoking cigs and drinking beer again”. I think the insight is maybe substances help to distract me from my mental and physical health. The despondence or anxiousness I feel is still there when I am drinking, it’s just a little easier to ignore. Without the substances, I thought it would be easier to lose weight. Afterall, alcohol is a lot of calories. But actually, I think without regular installments of substance abuse, I’ve returned to food as a self-soothing tool.  So, that’s fun. 

There’s no clean answer for this section. I have rhythms and cycles, and I am just in a funk, likely caused by the strain of a new schedule. But I’m also writing music I’m proud of, finishing my MFA, hanging out with my wife and dogs, and having some gym sessions here and there. And I’ve been sober. So that’s very cool and not something I want to just dismiss. (I did have one single cig…but just one! I’m sorry!)

### Divinity & Red Rising

One non-sarcastic fun thing has been finding ways to entertain myself that aren’t going to a bar. I’ve started playing Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition with a friend. It’s a lot like Baldur’s Gate, if you’ve ever played that. And, because I can only play Divinity when they’re online, I restarted Baldur’s Gate as well. I’m really enjoying both of these games. 

And I’ve been reading. I just finished Red Rising and am about to start Golden Son. Darrow reminds me a bit of Ender. I love the prose. It makes me wish I were writing in the present tense, but it wasn’t working when I first drafted Gatebound. Maybe I’ll try redrafting a chapter in the present and see how it feels.

### Clarity

Well, for whatever reason, I do feel better and like I have achieved some sense of clarity after writing this. I love that about writing. It’s a tool in my toolbox for taking care of myself. 

This little check-in also made me feel a bit better about not advancing the Gatebound wordcount. I think a practical thing I can do is to clarify to myself that I am not in a phase of producing new words. I am in a phase of tying up the thesis submission. Maybe I should set a deadline. As a matter of fact, let’s say for January, it’s perfectly okay if I don’t add to the wordcount of Gatebound. The goal for January is to submit my thesis and apply for graduation. 

Anyways, thanks for reading.
