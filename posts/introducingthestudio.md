Turns out, if you don’t pay your ghost.io subscription payment for a few months, they will quite literally delete your blog and all the writing within it. Nifty little feature they got there.

So, now my blog lives here. This is better anyway. Now I have full control of a website, because I’m building it, and God knows I needed another distraction from writing my book.

### The Sleepyhead T Studio Archive

I’ve been journaling off and on since I was sixteen years old. 

-insert pic of journals-

I’m immensely proud of that. I’m prone to distractions, rabbit holes, and wandering away from my desk, so it’s edifying to have artifacts that show me I have the capacity to finish things. And, they’re fun. I love looking through my old journals. 

Sadly, in my early twenties, I had a wash of cringe reading my high school journals and promptly threw them away. I can remember one entry that said something along the lines of, “I will never love again.”

Here are a handful of journal pages from across the years.

Ideally, this website will function similarly. It will be an archive for my family and me to look back on in cringe. 

It will also be a place for me to keep track of the shows my bands have coming up, so I can stop asking Lindsey when our next show is. It will be a place where I can put a list of my favorite compressors and my current vocal chain, so I can send it to a friend and say, “What do you think?” and he will say, “Why do you have three compressors on this vocal?” It will be a place where I keep a running list of my top 100 movies of all time and my worst 100 movies of all time.

This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

### How’s The Thesis Going?

The goal this year was 100k words. That wouldn’t get me a finished book, but it would be a good start. It’s December 19th as I write this. I have 25k on one draft and 55k on the current one. In other words, I have written 80,000 words this year.

Now, that’s not 100k words. But it is a lot.

For context, if we printed my 80,000 words on one single continuous line (not a sheet of paper—an actual strip that just continued with the line), that’d be about 40,000 inches, or 3,333 feet. The Empire State Building is only 1,454 feet tall. If we took those words and printed them into a book, we’d have about 320 pages. If we then held that book up in front of my forehead and you fired a small-caliber gun at my head, I just might survive the shot.

Now that’s how you get writers to up their daily word count. At the end of the year, we’re going to print a book from all the words you produced, and you’re going to use that to block a bullet shot at your head. My poor poets may suddenly find themselves fascinated by the epic poem form. 

I apologize. I’ve been reading “The Writing Life” by Annie Dillard, and she’s got me in a habit of thinking morbidly of the writing process.

Here’s a couple of cheery quotes from her book:

> The obverse of this freedom, of course, is that your work is so meaningless, so fully for yourself alone, and so worthless to the world, that no one except you cares whether you do it well, or ever. You are free to make several thousand close judgment calls a day. Your freedom is a by-product of your days’ triviality. A shoe salesman—who is doing others’ tasks, who must answer to two or three bosses, who must do his job their way, and must put himself in their hands, at their place, during their hours—is nevertheless working usefully. Further, if the shoe salesman fails to appear one morning, someone will notice and miss him. Your manuscript, on which you lavish such care, has no needs or wishes; it knows you not. Nor does anyone need your manuscript; everyone needs shoes more. There are many manuscripts already—worthy ones, most edifying and moving ones, intelligent and powerful ones. If you believed Paradise Lost to be excellent, would you buy it? **Why not shoot yourself, actually, rather than finish one more excellent manuscript on which to gag the world?**

and, this one:

> “Few sights are so absurd as that of an inchworm leading its dimwit life. Inchworms are the caterpillar larvae of several moths or butterflies. The cabbage looper, for example, is an inchworm. I often see an inchworm: it is a skinny bright green thing, pale and thin as a vein, an inch long, and apparently totally unfit for life in this world. It wears out its days in constant panic. 
> 
> Every inchworm I have seen was stuck in long grasses. The wretched inchworm hangs from the side of a grassblade and throws its head around from side to side, seeming to wail. What! No further? Its back pair of nubby feet clasps the grass stem; its front three pairs of nubs rear back and flail in the air, apparently in search of a footing. What! No further? What? It searches everywhere in the wide world for the rest of the grass, which is right under its nose. By dumb luck it touches the grass. Its front legs hang on; it lifts and buckles its green inch, and places its hind legs just behind its front legs. Its body makes a loop, a bight. “All it has to do now is slide its front legs up the grass stem. Instead it gets lost. It throws up its head and front legs, flings its upper body out into the void, and panics again. What! No further? End of world? And so forth, until it actually reaches the grasshead’s tip. By then its wee weight may be bending the grass toward some other grass plant. Its davening, apocalyptic prayers sway the grasshead and bump it into something. I have seen it many times. The blind and frantic numbskull makes it off one grassblade and onto another one, which it will climb in virtual hysteria for several hours. Every step brings it to the universe’s rim. And now—What! No further? End of world? Ah, here’s ground. What! No further? Yike! 
> 
> “Why don’t you just jump?” I tell it, disgusted. “Put yourself out of your misery.”

I must tell you that I am so proud of my 80,000 words. Some of them are even good. I’ve only got a semester left in my MFA, so I don’t think I will finish the book by the end of the program. But I do think I will finish the book at some point. Perhaps even by this time next year. 

Anywho, thanks for stopping by.
